# Require Text Challenge
How would you like to stop wasting time on the internet?

Inspired by the book Atomic Habits by James Clear, I set about making a chrome extension that would fulfill the books 2nd Law of Breaking Bad Habits. That is to make the habit that I wanted to break unattractive.

To do this the extension aims to create a minor paint point every time that you want to browse a page that you shouldn't be on.

It does this by requiring the user to type in a small randomly generated string correctly with no mistypes for the page to unlock.

Having this happen every time you open up a new page or switch tabs to that page adds a cost to browsing.

The string isn't untypable and it should be easy enough for the user to do without looking to disable the extensions.

Ultimately the only one who can make a choice to kick a bad habit is the user. This extensions isn't meant to make the website unattainable but marginally more effortful to access and thus over long periods of time making it systematically more undesirable and unrewarding to use.
